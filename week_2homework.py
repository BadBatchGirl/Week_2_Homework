#Exercise 1: Fahrenheit to Celsius
#prompt your user for the degrees in Fahrenheit
#Display the degrees in Fahrenheit and its equivalent in Celsius on the Console
# num1 = int(input("Please enter degrees in Fahrenheit: ")) 
# num2 = -(num1-32) * 5/9
# print(f"{num1}°F")
# print(f"{num2}°C")

#Exercise 2: Sales Tax
# Prompt your user for the price of their product before taxes
# Prompt the user to give you the sales tax
# Price = float(input("Please enter the price of the item: $"))
# Sales_tax = float(input("Please enter the sales tax: "))
# Percent = Sales_tax / 100 
# final_price = Price * Percent + Sales_tax
# print(f"${final_price}")

# Exercise 3: Tip Calculator
# Prompt the user to give you the total bill
# Prompt the user to give you what percent they would like to tip
# Display to the user the amount of tip they would owe
# total_bill = float(input("Please enter the amount of the total bill: $"))
# tip = float(input("What percent would you like to tip? "))
# tip_amount = total_bill * tip/100
# print(tip_amount)

# Exercise 4: Bill Dividends
# Prompt the user to give you the total bill
# Prompt the user to give you how many people are contributing
# Display to the user, the amount each contributor would need to pay
# total_bill = float(input("Please enter the amount of the total bill: $"))
# people = int(input("How many people are contributing?'"))
# amount_per_person = total_bill / people
# print(f"${amount_per_person}")
